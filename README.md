#MaGDAA - WInSTON #

The [Mass Gathering Data Acquisition and Analysis][magdaa] project, MaGDAA for short, is a collaboration between the [Flinders University Disaster Research Centre][fudrc] and [The Serval Project][sp] at [Flinders University][fusa] in South Australia.

The focus of the project is on the development of an [Android][android] based platform that can be used to acquire and analyse data at a mass gathering event. For example at a music festival, Schoolies Week, or any other event where a crowd has gathered.

The focus of this application is to connect to a [weather station][weather] station, collect information from it and share the information on a Serval Mesh Network.

More information about the software is available in the [MaGDAA Wiki][wiki].
